Signed application for TETD, using SHA-256 and RSA-3072. Run as follows.

```
cd application_level && sh test.sh
[or cd school_level && sh test.sh]
```

The RSA in the school\_level directory uses CRT acceleration. In actual applications, it is recommended to refer to the application\_level subdirectory.
